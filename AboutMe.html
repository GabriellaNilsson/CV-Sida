                        <article class="p-aboutme">My name is Gabriella Nilsson. I was born and raised in the county of Dalarna. In 2021, I moved to the city of Hudiksvall, where I now live with my partner and two cats. I'm currently studying to become a software engineer at Edugrade AB in Hudiksvall. My biggest hobbies are gaming, vintage and programming, but I also enjoy sewing, baking, studying languages (linguistics), delving history and reading books. I've studied German, both in Germany and in Sweden, at Uppsala University. Additionally, I pursued Korean language studies in Seoul, South Korea. After returning to Sweden, I took a Korean course at Stockholm University. My current goal is to complete my education and learn as much as possible.</article>
